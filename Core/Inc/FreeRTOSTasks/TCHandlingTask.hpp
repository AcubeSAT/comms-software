/**
The HAL_UARTEx_ReceiveToIdle_DMA() function allows to handle reception of Data from Hyperterminal
using DMA and notify application of already received data while the reception is still ongoing.
Received characters are handled by DMA and are stored in the user aRXBufferUser buffer.
Notifications to application, that some data are available in reception buffer, are done
through the execution of a user callback : HAL_UARTEx_RxEventCallback().
This callback will be executed when any of following events occurs :
- HT (Half Transfer) : Half of Rx buffer is filled)
- TC (Transfer Complete) : Rx buffer is full.
(In case of Circular DMA, reception could go on, and next reception data will be stored
    in index 0 of reception buffer by DMA).
- Idle Event on Rx line : Triggered when RX line has been in idle state (normally high state)
for 1 frame time, after last received byte.
